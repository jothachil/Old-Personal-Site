                <h1>Best Practices for 404 page design</h1>
                <time class="post-time">1 March 2017</time>
                <section class="post-content load-img">
                    <p>I got a call from my dad asking me what a 404 error means. He was totally frustrated and thought that he did something wrong on the internet which caused the error. He called me up to understand what it means.</p>
                    <p>This is a clear indication that most 404 pages are poorly designed. I started researching a few websites to understand how they implement 404 pages.</p>
                    <h2>What is an error message?</h2>
                    <p>An error message describes a problem that stops a user from completing a task.</p>
                    <p>According Neilison Message Guidelines for error message an error message should be:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Explicit</b>: Indication that something has gone wrong</li>
                        <li><b>Human-readable:</b> Instead of obscure codes or abbreviations such as “an error of type 2 has occurred”, error messages should be constructive and friendly in nature.</li>
                        <li><b>Polite</b>: Phrasing that doesn’t blame users;</li>
                        <li><b>Precise</b>: Descriptions of exact problems, rather than vague generalities such as “<i>syntax error</i>”.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Common problems in 404 pages</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Not able to clearly convey the error to the user.</li>
                        <li>Not Humane, use of Cryptic numbers. Error message 404.</li>
                        <li>Vague terms ex: URL not found, server issue</li>
                        <li>Not providing direction what to do next.</li>
                        <li>Jargon. What does syntax error mean?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Design better 404 pages</h2>
                    <br>
                    <h5> 1. Convey clearly to the user what happened wrong</h5>

                    <h5> 2. Don’t respond as machine, responds as human</h5>
                    <img src="img/blog-404-page/twitter-error.png" data-action="zoom" alt="">

                    <p>Avoid cryptic numbers like 404 and terms like URL, server issue etc.</p>
                    <h5> 3. Seize the humor in the situation</h5>
                    <img src="img/blog-404-page/humor-error.png" data-action="zoom" alt="">

                    <p>The message should still be clear, and polite. Something went wrong, so pleasing humor is a bonus when it happens.</p>
                    <h5> 4. Light their pathway.</h5>
                    <img src="img/blog-404-page/amazon-error.png" data-action="zoom" alt="">
                    <p>Include links that may send users down an alternative path, or to the home page</p>
                    <h5> 5. Keep the footer and header in 404 page</h5>
                    <img src="img/blog-404-page/behance-error.png" data-action="zoom" alt="">

                    <p>Avoid removing footer and header from 404 page this loose the sense of navigation in user. The user always like to have control over the navigation.</p>
                    <p>These small changes will improving the user experience significantly, by reducing frustrations and keeping them on path to completion.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for reading and best of luck in your future!</p>
