                    <p class="text-align-left">This is a design sprint that I did for one my side project Basically, a two day action of â€” research,,
                        wireframing, designing and documenting the whole process parallely. To reduce the scope of design
                        I have to go with customer base that I am easily to accessible </p>

                    <h4>PROCESS</h4>
                    <img src="img/swift-drop-process.svg" alt="">
                    <p>Due to time constraint, I had reduced the scope of the design. Firstly I targeted this design to be used
                        by small retails shops to transport their good on demand. Basically Uber for good transport.
                    </p>
                    <p>The design only consists of the consumer part of the whole design. I kicked off this project with
                        <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/SwiftDrop-1tBFEFDqZxlWYUduScr3h" target="_blank">user interview</a> to get a better understanding of the user I am designing for. This helped me to
                        point out their pain points of the user. After user interview, I was able to sketch proto-persona
                        detailing their demographics, behavior, and needs.</p>
                    <p>User Persona acted good tool help which helped me be to come up with ideas and assumptions which would
                        help to resolve the user problems. After sketching ideas I started creating wireframing the concept
                        app. Wireframing helped to come with iteration very fast and get feedback with user flow and an overall
                        understanding of app to the user.</p>
